               <h2>A little about me:<br>
                  I decided to go back to school after a long time away.
                              <br>
                              I work full time at Kaiser hospital and am going to school full time on top of that.
                              <br>
                              This semester has been challenging thus far,
                              <br> in that I can't find time for myself,
                              <br>but I'm being optomistic about accepting the educational challenge to further myself in life.
                              <br>
                              <br>
                              Feel free to contac me through my social links which are attached,
                              <br>
                              and get lost in my tumblr blog so that you can get a feel of what inspires me.
